    "Summary of The Arabian Nights. The Porter and The Three Ladies":
    "In Baghdad a lonely porter one day met a rich woman in the market. She ordered him to follow her and help here carry exquisite groceries. As she was filling her basket with various delicacies the porter couldn’t believe his eyes but followed the woman to her house. When he stepped into the house he met sisters of the buyer who were of equal beauty and he met no man in the house. Amazed at the way the women live he begged them to let him stay. And they did on the condition that he would submit to their command and ask no questions. They were drinking wine and savoring food and dancing. Eventually, women threw themselves naked into the pool and so did the porter. Enjoying the evening, they heard a doorbell ring. At the door stood three dervishes with a shaven head and blind in the right eye. They claimed to have travelled far from Baghdad and asked to let them in. The women allowed once again on the condition that the dervishes ask no questions. As they were playing music and drinking and having their fun the doorbell rang once again. That very night Caliph Harun-Al-Rashid had gone into the city with his vizier and they happened to pass the house. Amazed at what he saw Caliph asked women to let him and his vizier in and they did on the same condition. And they went on drinking wine and singing. All of a sudden, their fun ceased. The buyer ordered the porter to bring her a dog. The porter did as he was told to and dragged the black dog forward.  The owner beat the dog and then held the dog to her chest and whipped. Then she ordered the porter to bring another dog and did the same thing to it she did to the first one.  After that everyone went to sleep. When she dressed down the caliph saw numerous marks of blows and lashes. Unable to curb his curiosity he and the dervishes forced the porter to ask women what was going on.  The owner got furious and all of a sudden 7 slaves with swords appeared and captured men. Under the threat of death they begged the women not to take their lives. They agreed on the condition that men tell their stories. ",

He travelled fine for forty days and on the forty first day the wind rose and the sea went wild. The captain warned Ajib that they will die because the storm drives them towards the cursed lodestone.  On the mountaintop there is a dome of Andalusian brass. And on the dome there is a rider who has an engraved with charms tablet on his chest, who drives all the boats to their doom. Ajib lived after a shipwreck and had a dream.

    "Summary of Garden of the Forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges":
    "We get the document of Dr. Yu Tsun's (former teacher of English and German spy during World War I) deposition against the British. The beginning of the story was lost, and the narration starts from the middle. The protagonist (Dr. Yu Tsun himself) understands his vulnerable position – his spy mission was disclosed, and he might be caught by Captain Richard Madden from Ireland serving in the British army. The only thing left for Tsun to outwit the Captain – take his gun and follow the address where he can pass on the missive. Huddling among carriages, Tsun arrives. After getting out of the train in the suburbs and having a chit-chat with children, the main character goes towards the house of Dr. Stephen Albert. A forking and sinuous road finally gets Tsun to the summer house with Chinese music. Stephen Albert and Yu Tsun got involved in the story of Tsun’s ancestor. Ts'ui Pen created the 'garden of forking paths', governed the city, but gave up politics for two things. Firstly, to write a novel. Secondly, to build a maze. Descendents' critique of Ts'ui Pen exists because he had toyed idly with the art, had failed the novel and the labyrinth both. The novel had no chronological sense, and the labyrinth was never found. Hopefully, Stephen Albert was a prominent Sinologist who has studied Ts'ui Pen’s riddles – he could explain to Tsun that the intricate novel and 'the garden of forking paths' are united. Both of them present the bifurcation story. To put another way, characters of Ts'ui Pen’s novel have an endless amount of outcomes. And the maze is not even physical – it exists only in time. As a result of it, actors can exist in different alternative universes in one moment, each decision allows us to follow the unique space – that is how the scenery of bifurcations works. Occasionally, Captain Richard Madden was on the trail. He arrived in the suburbs. To keep Ts'ui Pen’s story a secret, Tsun shoots Albert with the gun, and Albert is assassinated. Captain Madden arrests Yu Tsun, but Tsun triumphs again. He had no choice but to kill someone called Albert while the secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. He relayed key information about the location of an enemy artillery base in the city of Albert."
